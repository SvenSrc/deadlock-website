# Deadlock Website
---
This is a Website that reads Data from an API and then creates it with the help of JavaScript. In HTML, mostly id's and classes are defined.

These stats are for example how much Health a hero has or what kind of Ability they have.

The API I used: https://deadlock-api.com/

<br>

It is not meant to be something special and is not really optimized. It is just a little fun project.

You can freely use it, if needed.

## How to start
It uses Node JS and you can start the App with "npm start". But maybe you need to type in "npm upgrade" first and then you can start it.

It then starts the app itself and a Proxyserver. The Proxyserver is needed because of CORS as it received Data from an API.

It was tested on the Firefox Browser
